            <p class="about-info"> - Hi there! I&#39;m 20 years old and am enrolled at National University&#39;s Fairview Bachelor of Science in
                Information Technology (BSIT) degree for my second year. My name is Yumi Borlongan. Despite my
                initial doubts, I ultimately chose to pursue an IT degree because I think that technology improvements
                would play a significant role in shaping the future. I&#39;m excited to learn and grow in this dynamic industry
                so that I can be prepared for the rapidly changing technological landscape.</p>
